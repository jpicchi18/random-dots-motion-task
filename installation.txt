INSTALLING PYTHON FOR OS X:
    (1) install homebrew via this link:
        https://brew.sh/
    
    (2) install python3 with the following command:
        brew install python3

RUN THE SCRIPT ON MAC:
    (1) add execute permissions to the bash script:
        chmod a+x run_on_mac.sh

    (2) run the bash script:
        ./run_on_mac.sh

(if bash script doesnt work) SETTING UP THE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT FOR OS X:
    (1) navigate to the "rdm_repo" directory

    (2) if the directory already contains a ".env" directory, delete it with this command:
        rm -rf .env

    (2) create the virtual environment with this command:
        virtualenv -p python3 .env

    (3) activate the virtual environment with this command:
        source .env/bin/activate
    
    (4) install the necessary packages, using this command:
        pip install -r requirements.txt

    (5) run the python script with this command:
        python3 path/to/repo/rdm_repo/resulaj.py

    (6) deactivate the virtual environment when your finished running the trials, using this command:
        deactivate

    (6) to reactivate the virtual environment and run the script in the future, start from step (3) above.
        you can skip step (4) because the packages will already be installed.

INSTALLING PYTHON AND VIRTUALENV FOR WINDOWS:
    (1) Download Python package from https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-364/ and
        install it. Run cmd as administrator and run these commands...

    (2) Try these commands. if they don't work, try the commands in step (3)
        pip install virtualenv
        cd path/to/rdm_repo/
        virtualenv -p path/to/python3/python.exe .env # This creates the virtual environment
        .env\Scripts\activate.bat                     # This activates the virtual environment
        # run the python script rdm_repo/resulaj.py...
        pip install -r requirements.txt               # This installs all the packages
        .env\Scripts\deactivate.bat                   # This deactivates the virtual environment

    (3) alternatively, try these commands:
        rm -rf .env
        py -m pip install virtualenv
        py -m venv .env
        ./.env/Scripts/activate
        py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
        py -m resulaj
