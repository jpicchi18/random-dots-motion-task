LITERATURE VALUES:
diameter of aperture = 10-14 degrees
density = ~16.7 dots/(degree)^2/sec or 15.6 dots/(degree)^2/sec (flexible variable)
frequency (1/(time between frames)) = 75 Hz
target = .8 deg diameter 10 deg from midline
dot speed = 7.1 deg/sec
home position = filled circle of radius 1cm
target positions = circles of radius 1.5 cm, 20 cm from home and 28 deg from midline
cross in the middle of the aperture that participants had to focus on throughout trials
viewing distance of 40cm (used chin and headrest to make it consistent)

TIMING DURING THE TRIAL:
before stimulus appears, targets displayed for some time in exponential distribution with mean 0.82s and range 0.7-1.0s
participants could view for as long as needed up to 2.0s
movement duration (time between leaving home position and selecting a target) required to be 500+/-200ms
feedback on accuracy came after the response or 2.0s after onset of the stimulus (whichever is later)
intertrial interval = 1.0s with blank screen
